This project consists of a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ randomly selected cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. It utilizes a simple Python library (CitiPy) and the OpenWeatherMap API using a series of successive API calls to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Includes various scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:


Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
